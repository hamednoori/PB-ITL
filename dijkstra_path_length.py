# This program is for a novel architecture for traffic light control system which can form and manipulate 
# vehicular platoons using clusters of traffic lights. This method, called Platoon-Based Intelligent Traffic Lights (PB-ITL) 
# is based on coordinated traffic lights that are connected and are also able to communicate with vehicles wirelessly. PB-ITL 
# groups traffic lights in clusters and each cluster tries to provide proper green status for the platoon of vehicles, using the
# Platooning concept which is seeking to utilize close to full capacity of roads. 
# This lib is a Python-based program which can simulate a city with dynamic intelligent traffic lights.
